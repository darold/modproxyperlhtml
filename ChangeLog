15 Aug 2012 - Version 3.4

	- Add support of space characters in ProxyHTMLURLMap an ProxyHTMLRewrite
	  pattern definition. The issue reported by Steffen Rheinhold occurs
	  when you want to rewrite some HTML code with space character in it.
	  As space is the separator character used between the search pattern
	  and the string to substitute. For exemple writing such a replacement:

		PerlAddVar ProxyHTMLRewrite "ajaxurl[\t\s]+=[\t\s]+'/blog' ajaxurl = '/www2.domain.org/blog'" 

	  is now fully supported, before it should break after the first space
	  of the replacement string and using '\s' in this replacement string
	  will not solve the problem as it still write 's' instead of a space.
